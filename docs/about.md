I learned the microcontroller programming for 4 years, and the msp430g2553 is my first MCU. But I think that I need to form a picture of MCU programming, everything about it from scratch. That also help me dispect microcontroller more clearly.

I got a lot of difficulty with the msp430g2553 programming for the first time. And day by day I got knowledge about the MCU programming. So I write this blog with viewpoint that we are learning the microcontroller from scratch. Because the msp430g2553 is small 16-bit RISC CPU, it is relevant to whom want to learn the MCU programming from scratch.

Thanks for reading!
