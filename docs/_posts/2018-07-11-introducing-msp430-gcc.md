## What's the purpose of this project?

The purpose of this project is used to learning the msp430g2 microcontroller from scratch. And it also provide some basic knowledge about microcontroller programming.

## Prerequisites

* Main board: MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad Development Kit

> The MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad Development Kit is an easy-to-use microcontroller development board for the low-power and low-cost MSP430G2x MCUs. It has on-board emulation for programming and debugging and features a 14/20-pin DIP socket, on-board buttons and LEDs.

* Other devices will be required, depending on each examples.

## Building the environment

In this project, the Ubuntu PC will be used for developing. So, all software tools are running on Linux environment. Some tools are used as following:

* [gcc-msp430](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE)
  > Open Source Compiler for MSP Microcontrollers

* [mspdebug](https://dlbeer.co.nz/mspdebug/)
  > A free debugger for use with MSP430 MCUs.
