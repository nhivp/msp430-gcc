In this post, we will dissect the MSP430G2 package.

## What MSP430 has in package?

## Von-Neumann vs Harvard

These two are the basic types of architecture in the microcontroller. but most often Harvard based architecture is mostly prefered.

Below are schemes about fetching data and instructions.

* Von Neumann architecture has a single common memory space where both program instructions and data are stored. It uses same physical pathways for instructions and data.

* Harvard architecture computers have separate memory areas for program instructions and data. It has physically separate pathways for instructions and data.

  ![Harvard Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhivp/msp430-gcc/master/docs/assets/img/harvard.PNG "There are two or more internal data buses which allow simultaneous access to both instructions and data.")

From the features, it shows that the time for execution of Von-Neumann is high. But the advantage is its simplicity and the cost of hardware is cheaper.
